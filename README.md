Remember to configure your directory correctly as you will need to find this as you develop. My directory for my projects is: C:\Users\Maximo\IdeaProjects and I am cloning the project inside the body-bots folder

Ensure the project location is correct


2️⃣ Run the Bot
To launch the bot in RuneMate, open the IntelliJ Terminal (Shortcut: CTRL + `) and run:

``` 
./gradlew runClient
```

RuneMate should now open, and you should see the woodcutter bot in the bot list.

❓ Troubleshooting
Bot Not Appearing in RuneMate?
Check if the compiled bot is in the correct directory:
``` pgsql
C:\Users\Your-User-Name\IdeaProjects\cody-bots\build\libs
```

Make sure Gradle built the bot successfully:
``` 
./gradlew build
```

Restart RuneMate and try again.
By default, IntelliJ projects are stored in:

```
C:\Users\Your-User-Name\IdeaProjects\
```
You can set a different location, but make sure to adjust paths accordingly.


📌 Summary
✅ Clone the repo
✅ Set up IntelliJ
✅ Run ./gradlew runClient to launch the bot
✅ Check build/libs if the bot doesn’t appear in RuneMate
🚀 Now you’re ready to start bot development! 🔥
